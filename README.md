# PERSONAL-BANK-STATEMENT-ANALYSIS

# OVERVIEW
This project represents a practical financial analysis initiative I embarked on using my personal UBA bank statement data. My goal was to assess personal financial habits, identify spending inefficiencies, and ultimately build a clear, actionable picture of where my money goes and how to optimize my financial decisions.
This wasn not just a visual exercise, it was a critical thinking process, where I applied analytical reasoning, business intelligence tools, and SQL skills to solve a real-life problems and how i can take control of my spending patterns and increase my financial resilience.
