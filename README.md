# PERSONAL-BANK-STATEMENT-ANALYSIS

# OVERVIEW
This project represents a practical financial analysis initiative I embarked on using my personal UBA bank statement data. My goal was to assess personal financial habits, identify spending inefficiencies, and ultimately build a clear, actionable picture of where my money goes and how to optimize my financial decisions.
This wasn not just a visual exercise, it was a critical thinking process, where I applied analytical reasoning, business intelligence tools, and SQL skills to solve a real-life problems and how i can take control of my spending patterns and increase my financial resilience.


# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
* SQL : I Used to import the data as a csv file, data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and preparation.
* Power BI: I Used for data modelling, dashboard creation, DAX measures, visual design, and interactivity.
* Data Source: PDF file from Uba bank which was converted to CSV file.
